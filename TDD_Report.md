# TDD Report

Jesse wrote his two components using TDD.

# Implementation Order

I set my implementation order by the way the tests were ordered. This was logical because I wrote the tests in an order such that the small complexity tasks were at the start and the large complexity tasks were at the end. This meant that I was able to build functionality out that allowed the large complexity tasks to be easier.

Side Note: I forgot to point this out in a commit before I started, but I promise that I actually followed this order.

# Efficiency of the process

I felt like the process was pretty inefficient (it took me a long long time to write this small amount of code), but I think in the end it was worth it. As of now, I have *way* more test code than source code, which is frustrating, but good I think.

# Knowledge of how I was going to test the code

This was actually extremely helpful. Because I had to write the tests first, I had to think through how everything was going to be implemented down to the very last detail (so that I could test it). This allowed me to catch a variety of logic bugs, which I would have otherwise missed until I was deep in constructions.

# Later bugs

I haven't done extensive testing besides the TDD tests I wrote, but thus far I haven't found any bugs that I didn't tackle when I was writing the code to pass the tests.

# What would I change next time?

I feel like I had too much of an emphasis on getting the test case perfect the first time, so that I could just write the source code and make it pass. I feel that if I allowed myself to jump between the two more, I might have an easier time with both. That being said, being more intertwined may limit the helpfulness of TDD, I can't be sure.

# Final thoughts

Overall, I thought it was a good process. I have written a fair amount of test code in my day, and have even done a little bit of TDD, but the strict format I enforced on myself when implementing this code made it feel more *real*. In the future, I want to get more comfortable with TDD--I really like that it gets writing tests out of the way, because if I leave them for last I will never do them.
