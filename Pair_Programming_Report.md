# Pair Programming Notes

Jesse and Brennen pair programmed the API together. (Brennen is writing this)

## Role Divisions:

We both took turns driving while the other navigated looking for bugs and looking ahead at the next section of code that we would be working on.
We began with Brennen writing code and Jesse navigating, because Jesse was coming from having written solo code and wanted a break, but after a while switched to see if the reversed roles would work better.

## Time Effectiveness

Jesse had a harder time keeping his hands off of code, and was frequently tempted to pick up another laptop so that he could look back at sections of code he had written previously, so when he was navigating he felt like his time was being less effectively.
I had an easier time navigating since I was less comfortable with Flask programming than Jesse, and I felt that my stumbling though some syntax or layout errors that are specific to Flask was also not effective.
We both felt like our time was being used more effectively when Jesse was coding and I was navigating.

## Speed of Code Development

Because there is such a high degree of interoperability between our two parts, it definitely sped up our development to be able to understand both sides of each interaction as we wrote it, instead of having to look at the other's code in order to figure it out.
Also, since Jesse was more familiar with Flask and I was more familiar with the layout of this component, our speed was helped by having the other present.

## Quality of Code

We caught several of one anothers bugs that would have otherwise been relatively hard to detect. Debugging also went much quicker, as we were both able to find separate problems that were both contributing to the same error.

## Pleasantness

The experience was generally pleasant, with the slight caveat that scheduling times to work together in finals season is hard.

## Next Time

If we were to do this again for the same project, we would start with Jesse coding and me navigating. In terms of more general pair programming in the future, we would make sure that the workstation we were working at belonged to the coder, since ideosynchracies with one member's setup can be disorienting to the other.
